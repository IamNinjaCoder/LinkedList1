Given an unsorted singly Linked List, suppose you have reference (or pointer) to its head node only, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?'


i)   Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii)  Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv)  Deletion of the front node of the linked list

ANS ---> As mentioned in the question we have given an unsorted linked list  and pointer to it's head only so

1) This will take O(1) as it is given that we have pointer to the head
2) We have given only pointer to it's head only not the tail so this will take O(n) time
3) Same reason as 2
4) we can delete front node in O(1) time 

so the final ans will be 1 and 4 only
