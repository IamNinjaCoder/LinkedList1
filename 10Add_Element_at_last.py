# Consider the Singly linked list having n elements. What will be the time taken to add an node at the end of linked list if is initially pointing to first node of the list.
# That is only head is given to you. 

##ANS --- As we have given the pointer to the head of the linked list and we have to add a node at the end so for this we have to traverse the complete linked list then we will
#### reach at the end which is known as tail and we can add this will take O(n)
