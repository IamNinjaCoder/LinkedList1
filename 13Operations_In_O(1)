Given an unsorted singly Linked List, suppose you have references (or pointer) to its head and tail nodes, which of the following operation can be implemented in O(1) time?
i)   Insertion at the front of the linked list
ii)  Insertion at the end of the linked list
iii) Deletion of the last node of the linked list
iv)  Deletion of the front node of the linked list

Ans--- 1 2 4 will be correct  
so we can not delete tail element directly we need a prev pointer and we have to traverse the linked list then we can delete because this is singly linkedlist we have only pointer 
to it;s forward next position not the backward position
